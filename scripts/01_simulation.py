# Import necessary modules
# Define function simulate_check_hat(N: int, num_people: int) -> list
#   Initialize a list to store results
#   Loop N times:
#       Generate a list of hats labeled from 1 to num_people
#       Randomly shuffle the hats
#       Count how many people get their own hat
#       Store the count in results list
#   Return results list

# If run as main:
#   Define number of people and number of trials
#   Run simulation function
#   Save results to CSV in outputs/
